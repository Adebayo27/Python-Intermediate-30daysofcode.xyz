# This Order

Given an **unsorted array of unique integers,** write a function named **order** that takes this as parameter and returns a **tuple of 2 elements.** <br>The first element should be the **length of the longest consecutive elements sequence** and the second a **sorted list of the remaining elements.** 
<br>If more than one sequence qualifies, **return the one with lower values.**
<br>
For example:
<pre>
given order([100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]) returns (4,[100,200])<br><br> where the longest consecutive elements sequence are [1,2,3,4].
</pre>
