<h1>Day 4: Bits of Gray</h1>

<p>Gray Code system is a binary number system in which every successive pair of numbers differs in only one bit. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during transitions.
Given a number of bits n as input, write a function named bits_of_gray that returns a list of the gray codes in order as described above.</p>


<p>For example,</p> 


<pre>bits_of_gray(2) function  returns: ['00', '01', '11', '10']<br>
 bits_of_gray(3) function  returns: [ '000', '001','011','010','110','111','101','100']</pre>
