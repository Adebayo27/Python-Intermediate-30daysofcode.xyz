# Flooding

An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

Given an image array, coordinate (x, y) representing the pivot coordinates (row and column) of the flooding, the filler and the pivot pixel itself, Write a function named overflow that "floods" the image with the filler.

To "flood" an image, starting with the pivot pixel, replace the value of any pixel that is connected 4-directionally and is equal to it with the filler value as well as the pivot pixel. Do this for these surroundings pixels and continue till the image is flooded.

At the end, return the modified image array.

Example:

1.image =[[1, 2, 1],
[2, 1, 1],
[1, 2, 1]]

overflow(image, ( 1,1), 3, 1) returns
[[1, 2, 3],
[2, 3, 3],
[1, 2, 3]]


2.image =
[2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2],
[1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3],
[2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1],
[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]]

overflow(image, (0,0), 4, 2) returns:
[[4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2],
[1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3],
[4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1],
[4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2],
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1],
[4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2]]


3.image= [
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 9],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 2, 0]]

overflow(image,(4,5),2,3)

returns:
[[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 9],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0],
[5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 0]]
