# MY CARS' WORTH

You won a massive, probably unreal lottery from **GeekTutor Motors**

 

You come to the garage and you see different cars parked there in a straight line.

 All the cars are of **different worth.**

You are allowed to choose any amount of cars and they will be yours.

**The only condition is that you can't select  2 cars that are parked beside each other**. **'''i.e There must be at least one car between any 2 cars you choose.'''**

 

Given an array where the elements are arranged in order of the cars and the magnitude of each element is the worth of the car.

 

Write a function **``my_cars``** that takes in the array and RETURNS the maximum worth of cars you can get from GeekTutor 

 

e.g 

<pre>
my_cars([30,15,60,75,45,15,15,45])

<br>will return 180

 
<br>
i.e 30, 60, 45, 45
<br>
<bold><i>Notice that none of these Elements are beside each other in the array</i></bold>
</pre>
